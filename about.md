Greetings, traveler. :wave:

I'm Ricky, and I began my journey in tech 5 years ago in IT and made the move over to cyber once that became boring and monotonous. I now spend my days drowning in caffeine and trying to keep up with the rapidly evolving field that is cyber security.

This blog focuses on malware research and experiences through the eyes of a Threat Analyst.
