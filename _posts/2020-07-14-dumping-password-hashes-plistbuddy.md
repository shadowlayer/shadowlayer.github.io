# Dumping Password Hashes With PlistBuddy

## What is PlistBuddy?

Lets start with what a plist (Property List) is in relation to OS X.

A plist file contains config information for an executable. (They store preferences and settings of applications.) The *"defaults"* command-line tool is often leveraged to modify values within plists.

> see [Edit Properly Lists in Terminal on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/edit-property-lists-apda49a1bb2-577e-4721-8f25-ffc0836f6997/mac)

Plistbuddy, located at `/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy`, allows you to manipulate and modify plist files using bash commands. Take a look at the [man page](https://www.manpagez.com/man/8/PlistBuddy/) for additional understanding and information.
